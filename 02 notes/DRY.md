**DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** is a software principle that states every piece of knowledge or logic should exist in only one place. It encourages avoiding code duplication to make programs easier to maintain, less error-prone, and more readable. By centralizing logic, updates or fixes only need to happen once.
